build is called when the widget is initially built.
build is also called whenever the widget's state changes or when the widget is rebuilt.
In Flutter, initState is a special method that's called when a widget is first inserted into the tree.
utc_offset: +01:00
now = now.add(Duration(hours: int.parse(offset)));
So, in summary, this line of code takes the now DateTime object and adds a duration to it, where the duration is equal to the UTC offset parsed from the offset string. This effectively adjusts the now date and time to account for the UTC offset.
